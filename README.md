# Air-Scrubber-Combination-Calculator

## Description

The Air Scrubber Combination Calculator is a Python program designed to determine and display possible air scrubber combinations to meet specific air change requirements for a three-dimensional space. This tool is particularly useful in scenarios where maintaining air purity is crucial, such as in mold remediation, plaster removal, or other applications requiring air quality control.
## Functions

- **User Input Handling**: The program gathers detailed information about the air scrubbers the user has, including the type of scrubber, its CFM (cubic feet per minute) rating, and the quantity available. It ensures the inputs are valid and unique, preventing duplicate entries for scrubber types.

- **All Combination Calculation**: It calculates all possible theoretical combinations of the provided air scrubbers, exploring every potential way to meet air change requirements without considering quantity constraints.

- **Applicable Combination Generation**: From the calculated combinations, the program generates and identifies only those combinations that can be realistically implemented based on the actual quantities of scrubbers the user has available.

- **Target CFM Calculation**: Based on the room dimensions and desired air changes per hour, the program calculates the target CFM needed to achieve the required air purity.

- **Unit Conversion**: If needed, the program converts room dimensions from meters to feet to ensure consistency in calculations and meet user preferences.

- **Display Results**: It provides a clear and organized display of all possible air scrubber combinations, highlighting both theoretical and applicable options. This helps the user understand which combinations can achieve the desired air change requirements with the available resources.

- **Input Validation**: Throughout the process, the program ensures that all user inputs are correctly formatted and valid, providing helpful error messages and prompts to guide the user to enter the correct information.
